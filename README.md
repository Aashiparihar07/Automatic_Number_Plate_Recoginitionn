Autonomous Number Plate Recognition using YOLO in Python
Overview
This project implements an Autonomous Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection in Python. The system is designed to detect and recognize license plates in images and video streams, providing a valuable tool for automated vehicle surveillance, toll collection systems, parking management, and other applications requiring vehicle identification.

Features
Object detection: Utilizes YOLOv3 (or YOLOv4) for real-time object detection to locate vehicles and license plates within images or video frames.
License plate recognition: Extracts and recognizes license plate characters using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.
Real-time processing: Provides real-time processing capabilities for video streams, allowing for continuous monitoring and analysis.
Configurable: Offers configuration options to adjust detection thresholds, image preprocessing techniques, and OCR settings for optimal performance in different environments.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ANPR-YOLO-Python.git
Install dependencies using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ANPR-YOLO-Python
Run the ANPR system on an image or video file:
css
Copy code
python anpr.py --input input_file.jpg
or
css
Copy code
python anpr.py --input input_file.mp4
Optionally, adjust detection and recognition settings in the config.py file to customize the behavior of the ANPR system.
Examples
Sample input images and videos are provided in the examples directory for testing and demonstration purposes.
